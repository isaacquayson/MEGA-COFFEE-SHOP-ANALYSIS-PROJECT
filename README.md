## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data across various countries, products, and years 
to extract valuable insights that can drive data-informed decision-making. The analysis was carried out using:
•	SQL (for data extraction and transformation),
•	Power BI (for data visualization),
•	CSV Dataset (as the primary data source).

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The e-commerce company operates across multiple regions and offers a wide range of products, generating significant volumes of sales data each year. 
However, the organization faces a challenge in leveraging this data effectively to uncover insights into its overall performance. 
Decision-makers lack clear visibility into which countries, products, and time periods are driving profitability, where operational inefficiencies may be reducing margins,
and how customer purchasing behavior varies across regions. Without a structured analysis, 
it's difficult to make informed strategic decisions, allocate resources efficiently, or identify growth opportunities.

To address this, a data analysis project was initiated to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights. 
By cleaning and aggregating the sales data using SQL and visualizing key metrics in Power BI, the goal was to understand sales performance trends, 
assess cost-to-profit relationships over time, and highlight high-performing product and market segments. 
This would enable the business to focus on the most profitable areas, mitigate losses in underperforming regions, 
and ultimately improve the company’s financial performance through data-driven decisions.

## OBJECTIVES:
1.	Analyze Sales Performance Over Time.
2.	Evaluate Product-Level Profitability.
3.	Create a Visual Dashboard for Stakeholders.
4.	Build a Robust SQL Foundation for Data Extraction.
